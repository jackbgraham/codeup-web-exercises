<p>Ten Amazing Facts About Our National Parks:</p>

    <dt>Ghost Canyon National Park</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            Did you know that Ghost Canyon contains more ghosts per square acre than any other park in the US? Starting with the "Dehaunting Initiative" created by Senator Gugsy McEndo in 1983, many of the nation's well known haunted houses were demolished and fed into wood chippers. The organic waste from those wood chippers was then scattered as a layer of mulch in the riparian areas of Ghost Canyon. However, it seems the ghosts just kept on haunting, and they roam the park to this day.

        <p>
            The decomissioned Fort Blufford stands boldly on the banks of the Sassquitally river. A key strategic location in the war on drugs, until it was besieged by the cocaine cannibals motorcycle club in 1992. After the garrison commander was killed defending the flag, the base was declared "unbasable" and decommisioned.

            The old impact area is a favorite among locals, where you can find tons of unexploded ordnance (UXO). Which has recently resulted in several incidents at Sassquitally Middle School. If you find any UXO, please leave it where you found it.

        <p>
            Alexandros Hossgin was an eccentric millionaire who made his fortune in the nation's snack belt, selling the famous Cheezy-Figgy Pretzel Balls &#8482;.

            In the latter years of his life he funded an elaborate burial complex with a series of deadly traps to deter grave robbers. Despite protest and pushback from local religious leaders, Alexandros insisted that he would be able to take his riches with him into the afterlife. Many factory workers "volunteered" to be entombed within the mounds after his death in 1995.
