        <p>
            Did you know that Ghost Canyon contains more ghosts per square acre than any other park in the US? Starting with the "Dehaunting Initiative" created by Senator Gugsy McEndo in 1983, many of the nation's well known haunted houses were demolished and fed into wood chippers. The organic waste from those wood chippers was then scattered as a layer of mulch in the riparian areas of Ghost Canyon. However, it seems the ghosts just kept on haunting, and they roam the park to this day.

        <p>
            The decomissioned Fort Blufford stands boldly on the banks of the Sassquitally river. A key strategic location in the war on drugs, until it was besieged by the cocaine cannibals motorcycle club in 1992. After the garrison commander was killed defending the flag, the base was declared "unbasable" and decommisioned.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old impact area is a favorite among locals, where you can find tons of unexploded ordnance (UXO). Which has recently resulted in several incidents at Sassquitally Middle School. If you find any UXO, please leave it where you found it.

        <p>
            Alexandros Hossgin was an eccentric millionaire who made his fortune in the nation's snack belt, selling the famous Cheezy-Figgy Pretzel Balls &#8482;.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the latter years of his life he funded an elaborate burial complex with a series of deadly traps to deter grave robbers. Despite protest and pushback from local religious leaders, Alexandros insisted that he would be able to take his riches with him into the afterlife. Many factory workers "volunteered" to be entombed within the mounds after his death in 1995.

    <dd class="invisible">
        <p>Established in 1983 by the National Feral Cat Rescue act, Sponsored by Congresswoman Margaret Adams. This national forest spans over 300 acres in the shadow of mount Chicharon.
        </p>
        <p>Now overseen by head park ranger Margaret Adams, the park is home to a whopping population of feral cats which have decimated the local bird and rodent populations and caused unforseen environmental effects. The Park entrance hase kibble dispensing machines, where for the price of a quarter, you can get a good handful of kibble to feed the park's residents.

        <p>Ever wondered how the National Forest service keeps out wildlands stocked with fresh snakes? Come to the National Snakery and take a tour with our venomous snake experts.
        </p>
        <p>If you come in the springtime, be prepared for a treat, the forest service load masters and crew chiefs will be preparing Forest Service Cargo Planes for the annual snake drop! The load masters love quoting Samuel L Jackson, we've told them this wasn't family friendly, but they are mostly ignoring us.
        </p>
        <p>The snake drop refreshes our national parks with fresh snakes after they are depleted each year due to local events like the rattlesnake roundup.
